# LSDM-PDB
Large Scale Data Management Project (Spring 2022) based on the Protein Data Bank

(see pdf report for details about this project)



This project is implemented in the Google Colab notebook PDB_Analysis.ipynb

To install, process, and plot the data, simply open the .ipynb in Google Colab and run the cells in sequential order.

You may have to change the directory path during the mount to drive step, but otherwise everything should work fine.

Also note that downloading the files from the PDB archive can take some time, and if the connection times out you may have to re-run the cell to restart the download.
